Description: Motifs within biological sequences show a significant role. This package utilizes a user-defined threshold value (window size and similarity) to create consensus segments or motifs through local alignment of dynamic  programming with gap and it calculates the frequency of each identified motif, offering a detailed view of their prevalence within the dataset. It allows for thorough exploration and understanding of sequence patterns and their biological importance.
